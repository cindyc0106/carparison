## Project Details

Carparison is a full stack web application that was built for our final project at Lighthouse Labs in a collaborative environment.

  - Front-end was built using [React](https://create-react-app.dev/), CSS and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).
  - Back-end was built using Node.js, PostgreSQL and Express.
  - [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ca), [API Ninja Key](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/cars-by-api-ninjas/), [Kommunicate](https://www.kommunicate.io/), [Imagin Studio](https://www.imagin.studio/) and [EmailJs](https://www.emailjs.com/) were all incorporated within our application.
